# Interactive Project Meeting

Let's design a project together!

We'll interactively decide what kind of application to build and which language to use.

## üöÄ Project Design Flow Guide

### 1. Application Overview
- What problem do you want to solve?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the main features?

### 2. Technical Requirements
- Which programming language would you like to use? (Go, Python, JavaScript/Node.js, etc.)
- CLI app, web server, or library?
- Do you need external API integration?
- Will you use a database?
- What packages or frameworks would you like to use?

### 3. Project Structure
- Directory structure design
- Package/module organization
- Dependency management

### 4. Development Plan
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) definition
- Phased implementation plan
- Testing strategy

## üí° Example Questions

We'll proceed with Q&A like this:

**Claude**: First, what kind of application problem would you like to solve?

**You**: Example) I want to create a CLI tool to streamline file management

**Claude**: That's a great idea! Which language would you like to implement it in? Also, what specific features would you like? File search, organization, backup, etc...

## üéØ Goals

Through this dialogue, we'll determine:

1. **Project name and overview**
2. **List of main features**
3. **Technology stack**
4. **Project structure**
5. **Development phase plan**

## üìù Next Steps

Once the project design is finalized:
- Initialize repository with `/init-repo` command
- Create basic project structure
- **Mandatory documentation will be automatically created**:
  - `MEETING_NOTE.md` - This design session will be recorded
  - `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` - System architecture and features documented
  - `ROADMAP.md` - Implementation plan and feature roadmap
- Start implementation with TDD (Test-Driven Development)

## üìã Mandatory Documentation Integration

This meeting will automatically populate the three mandatory documents:

### MEETING_NOTE.md Updates
- Design decisions and rationale
- Technical choices and reasoning
- Feature prioritization discussions

### SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md Content
- Product overview and target users
- Core features and functionality
- Technical architecture decisions
- Technology stack selection

### ROADMAP.md Planning
- MVP feature definition
- Implementation phases
- Feature backlog and priorities
- Technical debt and future considerations
